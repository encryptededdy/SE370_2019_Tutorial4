\section{OS History}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2011 SE370/CS340 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    Very early computers did not provide interrupt handling capabilities. What advantage does an interrupt handling system provide?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  SPOOLing: Interrupt driven I/O, removing the need to wait for our computers to wait for I/O. Now we can do other stuff while waiting for our punch card input or printer output. Also allows for preemptive multitasking since a clock can interrupt.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2011 SE370/CS340 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    The first personal computer operating systems (including the Mac) were effectively resident monitors. Describe one way in which early PC operating systems were like resident monitors.
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Single task at a time
    \item No memory protection
    \item Standard IO routines in memory (as opposed to drivers and syscalls)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Virtual Machines}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Derived from 2018 SE370 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    What is an issue with using ``trap and emulate'' virtualization on x86 (prior to virtualization extensions such as Intel VT and AMD-V)?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Instructions exist that can run in both user and kernel mode, give different output (such as \texttt{POPF}).
    \item Instructions also exist to allow a program to determine whether it was in privileged.
    \item These instructions don't throw an exception (trap), and thus cannot be emulated by the VMM.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    \dots and how do hardware virtualization extensions help resolve this?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  Additional instructions allow the VMM to enter a special privledged mode (some call this ``ring -1'', although it's not a real protection ring), which allows it to host different guest kernels, all of which \emph{believe} they have ring 0 (kernel mode) access to the system.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2018 SE370 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    The Windows subsystem for Linux is NOT a virtual machine. Explain how it is different from a virtual machine.
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item No seperate kernel - instead, Unix syscalls are mapped into NT ones through a kernel module (LXCore)
    \item Somewhat similar to Application virtualization
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{exampleblock}{Trivia}
    WSL2 uses a real Linux kernel running under Hyper-V, due to performance and feasibility issues implementing all syscalls in LXCore/on top of NT.
  \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\section{Implementation}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2011 SE370/CS340 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    Give reasons why a language such as Java is seldom used to implement operating systems?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item No direct access to memory*
    \item Insufficient control over memory allocation*
    \item Runs inside JVM rather than directly on hardware
    \item \sout{Performance} - not entirely true
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{exampleblock}{Trivia}
    *One can technically manually allocate off-heap memory or access memory-mapped devices using \texttt{sun.misc.unsafe}
  \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\section{Processes and Threads}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2011, 2018 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    Explain the difference between a thread and a process?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  Processes have their own memory space and connections to files/devices (file descriptors), whereas threads typically share memory space within a given process (but have their own stack so they can be executing different code).
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2018 SE370 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    What is the most important difference between system level and user level threads, and what is a consequence of the difference?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With user-level threads, the OS only sees one thread per process, whereas with system-level threads the OS is aware of multiple threads per process.
    \item On a multiprocessor, different system-level threads can be scheduled on different processors, since the OS can schedule them on different processors.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Scheduling}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2018 SE370 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    In general a small time-slice makes computers responsive. Explain why this is so and what penalty is paid as the time-slice gets smaller.
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A context switch between two tasks takes a certain amount of time, as registers, stack pointers, etc. need to be switched out.
    \item As a result, smaller time slices means more context switches and thus lower throughput (but lower latency!).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Low-level C}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{2011 SE370/CS340 Test}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    What error do you commonly get if you try to access a pointer which has not been initialised correctly in Linux?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  Segmentation Fault (a memory access violation)
\end{frame}
